## 🚀 Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Verify Installation ✅
Dependencies are installed! Now install Playwright browsers:
```bash
cd /Users/haveninfoline/Desktop/playwright_repo
npx playwright install
```

### Step 2: Run Your First Test (5 minutes)
```bash
# Run example test to see it in action
npx playwright test tests/examples/example.spec.js --headed
```

You should see a browser open and tests running automatically!

### Step 3: Open Interactive UI Mode (Recommended)
```bash
npm run test:ui
```
This gives you an interactive interface to:
- Watch tests execute
- Time-travel through test steps
- Debug visually
- Perfect for learning!

### Step 4: Start Your Training
Open `TUTORIAL_GUIDE.md` and follow:
